    <header> Spirituality
    </header>
    <p> Spirituality in a witches coding work is a concept that may seem strange to apply to something that thrives on structure, code, formulas, and logic. For a coding witch, it is important to balance the structure/individualism with the world around her. She seeks to apply justice in ways that are often overlooked. In any culture, systems still reflect the eniviroment around them. A coding witch keeps this in mind, even as she implements that which would be considered scientific.
